I have had some key ideas, that resulted in, I believe, a powerful idea for how to learn. I thought I should share this idea. 
</p>
<div class="py-2"></div>
The idea is based on three key revelations,
<div class="pl-6">
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li class="pt-2"><a href="/post/a_shortification_on_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"># a shortification on "learning"</a> by Andrej Karphathy</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9907364-when-you-think-that-you-are-done-you-re-only-40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">What it means to be tired</a> by David Goggins & personal military experience</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="py-2"></div>
<p>
Please note, these ideas are very experimental and advanced. They are difficult to both explain and understand; the ideas might even be better described as a "feeling I have", rather than something more than that. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The skill of learning, as I will try to teach in this text, is not dependent upon the three revelations listed above, but I don't see anyone having success without first having had them. This is simply because it's such a far fetched idea, where each revelation has to first be personally felt, before it will become believable. Chances are, you might have only experienced one of these revelations, if not even that. If you have been in the military, and been through hell week (or a version of it), you will know what it means to be tired. Use this experience and compare it to the other two to get a feeling of what I'm talking about. If you have been through hell week, you know what it feels like to be tired and to keep pushing, so when you relate that to other stuff, you can recognize that feeling when it comes up. Same with meditation, I can explain what the feeling is, but if you have felt being in selflessness you will recognize it when it happens and you can use this (now new skill of yours) in new ways.
</p>

<p>
In short, the idea is to combine mindfulness with the process of learning, and realize that it's ok to continue to work when you are tired and still learn effectively. There is NO science backing up the idea that you can't learn when you are tired. To clarify, there is science showing people learn worse when tired, or that people perform worse when unmotivated (another word for burnout). But there is no science showing that you can't learn when you are tired. This is a feeling, and it's a feeling that can be controlled.

This might sound simple, but it's quite a bit more advanced than simply just working (ironically enough it's not, but for practical purposes it is).

Finding out what it means to be tired is a bit complicated. In theory you can just leave your house and walk for 2 days, yeah right now, do it. Get up and start walking. No food, bring one water bottle, and start walking. BUT! This is complicated...
</p>


<div class="py-2"></div>
3. How to learn is probably the easiest... **FINISH WRITING THIS**
<div class="py-2"></div>

<p>
The practice is about getting the feeling (or intentionally triggering it) and then examining that feeling, closely until it goes away. Either by it self, or by the recognition that the feeling is nothing but a feeling, which also will make it naturally go away.
</p>

<p class="text-xl">To finish writing:</p>
<div class="pl-6">
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>It is possible to realize that being tired from learning is just a feeling. </li>
        <li>You can still learn while you have the feeling of being tired/foggy in your head.</li>
        <li>Why is *promodoro* a thing? If the idea is that total work done will be grater by using this method, why don't you see chess players utilizing it. It seems a lot more likely it's a way to procrastinate and make the work more comfortable. (You still feel like you are working while you are taking breaks in between the sessions).If you have to do something difficult (like walk a really far distance in the military), you just accept it and continue to walk. There is nothing stopping you from walking 2 days in a row without food when you realize this.</li>
        <li>There is probably a lot of truth to the statement that your learning will be less effective when you are tired. This is probably true. But I believe that this effectiveness is often overplayed (it's a truth people want to be correct), and in reality you will still learn a lot if you keep on going.</li>
        <li>Motivation and tiredness/feeling foggy is just a feeling, can can be worked around using mindfulness.</li>
    
    </ol>

Learning is often portrayed like this: 
<br>
<p class="text-base">
    (Note: this is the reason for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"><i>promodoro</i></a>, and science can support this. This graph is probably very accurate for an unmotivated college student:
</p>
<p>

Personally, I think this graph is missing some crucial information. Namely, learning effectivness.
<img src="/promodoro2.png" alt="commonly thought of promodoro learning">
Better, but still not quite right. The graph is missing (1) the fact that it takes time to get into the zone, it takes time to load your working memory with what you need to understand and it takes time to practise this. The graph is also missing (2) the fact that you can still learn when you are tired. In fact, the boost you get from having your head filled with context about what you are trying to learn is probably worth more than what you lose from being tired.
</p>
<div class="py-2"></div>

In reality, learning probably looks a lot more like this (factoring out: the lack of motivation, dicipline and grit, or distractions, health, food breaks, etc.):

<p>
Now, using the logic established. If you by using mindfulness and meditation can control your feeling of tiredness and motivation (in reality also hunger), we can accomplish the effectiveness shown in the graph. 
The key here is that it takes a lot of time (1-2 h) before you are the most effective. Your RAM is full, you are learning at max efficiency. You can make the most amount of logical connections possible for where you are at in your knowledge of the field. You are spending the most amount of energy, which I bet is proportional to how much you learn.
</p>
<div class="py-2"></div>
<p>
Even if I'm way off with the guess, the area under the curve of how much work I get done is at least 2x that of someone who is using the promodoro technique. And as a result, I learn a lot more.
